warning: dynamic exception specifications are deprecated in C++11 [-Wdeprecated]
This makes it hard to find the error messages with the reason why the build failed.
solution Tell the C++ compiler not to include depreceation warnings.
instructions Add the compiler flag -Wno-deprecated to the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_INIT options in the file toolchain.cmake.

The writer, achary, clearly knows more about Eclipse and embedded programming than I do. I got a little stuck at a couple of stages so created this page to pass on my solutions.</description></item><item><title>Setting up yotta and C with the BBC Micro:bit by modifying the examples directory</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/setting-up-yotta-and-c-with-the-bbc-microbit-by-modifying-the-examples-directory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/setting-up-yotta-and-c-with-the-bbc-microbit-by-modifying-the-examples-directory/</guid><description>I set up to program the BBC Micro:bit (which I&amp;rsquo;ll call the microbit from now on) in C/C++ under Linux. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using micropython to program the boards up to now, but want to leverage the increased performance that using C can give and some of the C libraries that are available for e.g. encryption.
There is good documentation on the Lancaster University microbit github page:
https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/
I installed the offline tools as I spend a lot of time working at sea where you can&amp;rsquo;t always rely on having an internet connection.</description></item></channel></rss>
