A friend who knows far more than I about analog electronics recommended using a power op-amp, which is an op-amp capable of outputting a high current. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one of these to hand, so used a regular low power op-amp to drive the gate of an N-type MOSFET. I think that a power op-amp is just a regular op-amp with some meaty FETs inside and a package capable of disappating more heat than a regular puny op-amp.</description></item><item><title>Checking the resonant frequency of a piezoelectric crystal</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2019/05/checking-the-resonant-frequency-of-a-piezoelectric-crystal/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2019/05/checking-the-resonant-frequency-of-a-piezoelectric-crystal/</guid><description>Having failed to get a tactile response from a small piezoelectric crystal, I wanted to check that I was hitting it with the correct driving frequency. This is the frequency that makes the crystal resonate. I found a test circuit and method on this website. The schematic for the testing circuit shown below is copied from that website.
Piezoelectric circuit resonance frequency testing circuit from https://www.americanpiezo.com/knowledge-center/piezo-theory/determining-resonance-frequency.html
I breadboarded the circuit and used my Digilent Analog Discovery 2 as a network analyser to check on the resonant frequency.</description></item><item><title>200V piezo crystal driver</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2018/12/200v-piezo-crystal-driver/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2018/12/200v-piezo-crystal-driver/</guid><description>Spoiler alert: I got the driving circuitry to behave as planned, but I could not feel the crystal vibrate.
The idea is to use the tiny crystals used in piezoelectric motors to create an array of dots that can be made to vibrate under the area of a finger tip. This will be used to create a tactile display that can be felt. The initial aim would be an array of these crystals under an area the size of your fingertip.</description></item></channel></rss>
