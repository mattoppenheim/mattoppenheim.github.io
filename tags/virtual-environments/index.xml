Naturally, I had a few problems getting mine to work properly. I found that my globally installed libraries were visible the activated venv. The whole point of a venv is to isolate libraries. The globally installed libraries that are not also explicitly installed in the venv should not be usable.
I use Debian and the bash shell.
