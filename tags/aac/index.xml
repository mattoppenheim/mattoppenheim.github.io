If you are trying to interact with this software using your own program, you need to make sure to access the window that you intend to.
Problem I wrote some Python code to detect the use of Grid 3 or Tobii&amp;rsquo;s Communicator software for this project, to visually show when somebody who uses eyegaze technology interacts with the software.</description></item><item><title>Give Me a Minute idea in use in commercial AAC software</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2020/07/give-me-a-minute-idea-in-use-in-commercial-aac-software/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2020/07/give-me-a-minute-idea-in-use-in-commercial-aac-software/</guid><description>To understand this post, please read the first couple of paragraphs of my give-me-a-minute project page.
The idea presented in give-me-a-minute looks to be making it into commerical AAC products. I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend that my project influenced this development. Be nice to think it did though&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to reality now.
One implementation is as &amp;lsquo;partner windows&amp;rsquo; where the text being composed on an AAC display is mirrored to a second screen that faces away from the person composing the test.</description></item><item><title>Using the microbit to control switch access software</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2019/06/using-the-microbit-to-control-switch-access-software/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2019/06/using-the-microbit-to-control-switch-access-software/</guid><description>What is switch access software Many disabled people use specialist software to create speech or to interact with the environment (e.g. turn on lights). Some are unable to use keyboards or mice to operate this software, so use a variety of &amp;lsquo;switches&amp;rsquo;, such as push buttons. These buttons act like keys on a keyboard, or pretend to be a mouse click.
I took some hand held video of a switchable software package which enables speech to be created.</description></item></channel></rss>
