I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the mu-editor to work with micro:bit v2. This was frustrating as I wanted to check some existing code ran on v2 of the micro:bit as well as start to use some of the new feautures on board.
I solved this by following a tip from a comment on my first post.</description></item><item><title>Setting up mu-editor with the BBC micro:bit v1 on Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</guid><description>I recently set up an installation of Debian 10 and set up a tool chain for programming the BBC micro:bit with micropython. I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten some of the stumbling blocks I had the last time I did this, so am recording them here. Hopefully, this post will help you avoid them.

The instructions in this blog get you set up to work with the micro:bit v1 using mu-editor.</description></item></channel></rss>
