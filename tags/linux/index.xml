This blog post is here:

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the mu-editor to work with micro:bit v2. This was frustrating as I wanted to check some existing code ran on v2 of the micro:bit as well as start to use some of the new feautures on board.
I solved this by following a tip from a comment on my first post.</description></item><item><title>Setting up mu-editor with the BBC micro:bit v1 on Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</guid><description>I recently set up an installation of Debian 10 and set up a tool chain for programming the BBC micro:bit with micropython. I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten some of the stumbling blocks I had the last time I did this, so am recording them here. Hopefully, this post will help you avoid them.

The instructions in this blog get you set up to work with the micro:bit v1 using mu-editor.</description></item><item><title>Getting the login screen on hotel WiFi using Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/getting-the-login-screen-on-hotel-wifi-using-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/getting-the-login-screen-on-hotel-wifi-using-linux/</guid><description>Problem I can see that I am connected to the hotel WiFi on my laptop, but the login screen does not come up on my browser.

Here is a link to one guide.
I followed a guide on YouTube but had a few problems connecting to the pi zero w using ssh through Linux. Each time I put in: [code language=&amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; light=&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;] ssh pi@raspberrypi.</description></item><item><title>Booting a new Lenovo Thinkpad from USB stick to use Clonezilla</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/booting-a-new-lenovo-thinkpad-from-usb-stick-to-use-clonezilla/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/booting-a-new-lenovo-thinkpad-from-usb-stick-to-use-clonezilla/</guid><description>All I wanted to do was boot from my trusty Clonezilla USB stick to make a system back up of my shiny new Thinkpad X260.Â Long story short, you need to disable the &amp;lsquo;Secure Boot&amp;rsquo; option in the UEFI (what used to be called BIOS) to boot from a bootable Clonezilla USB stick.
I bought the X260 a couple of month&amp;rsquo;s ago. This is last year&amp;rsquo;s model, so I got it at a discount.</description></item><item><title>Installing linux mint 18.1 onto a Lenovo 260 with an encrypted home drive</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/installing-linux-mint-18-1-onto-a-lenovo-260-with-an-encrypted-home-drive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/installing-linux-mint-18-1-onto-a-lenovo-260-with-an-encrypted-home-drive/</guid><description>The simplest way I found to install Linux Mint 18.1 on to my Lenovo 260 with an encrypted home drive and a separate installation partition is to install the system using the simplest options, then afterwards encrypt your home drive and shrink down the installation partition using gparted. The rest of this post is how I failed to do this several times. Which is undoubtedly due to my lack of linux wisdom.</description></item></channel></rss>
