I run Debian 11.
How to install kicad nightly-build on Debian I got started with the information on this site
Create a .list file in the folder /etc/apt/sources.list.d. e.g. /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kicad-nightly.list.
Contents:
deb [arch=amd64] https://debian.sur5r.net/kicad-nightly bullseye main
If you are not running Debian bullseye, change the &amp;lsquo;bullseye&amp;rsquo; to whichever version of Debian that you are running.</description></item><item><title>Setting up a micropython editor with the BBC micro:bit v2 on Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-a-micropython-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-v2-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-a-micropython-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-v2-on-linux/</guid><description>This post follows on from my blog post that shows how to set up the mu-editor in Linux for v1 of the micro:bit. This blog post is here:

I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the mu-editor to work with micro:bit v2. This was frustrating as I wanted to check some existing code ran on v2 of the micro:bit as well as start to use some of the new feautures on board.
I solved this by following a tip from a comment on my first post.</description></item><item><title>Setting up mu-editor with the BBC micro:bit v1 on Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2021/01/setting-up-mu-editor-with-the-bbc-microbit-on-linux/</guid><description>I recently set up an installation of Debian 10 and set up a tool chain for programming the BBC micro:bit with micropython. I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten some of the stumbling blocks I had the last time I did this, so am recording them here. Hopefully, this post will help you avoid them.

The instructions in this blog get you set up to work with the micro:bit v1 using mu-editor.</description></item><item><title>Getting the login screen on hotel WiFi using Linux</title><link>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2020/09/getting-the-login-screen-on-hotel-wifi-using-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mattoppenheim.github.io/post/2020/09/getting-the-login-screen-on-hotel-wifi-using-linux/</guid><description>Problem I can see that I am connected to the hotel WiFi on my laptop, but the login screen does not come up on my browser.
