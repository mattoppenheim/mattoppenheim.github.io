The voltage to the LEDs is pulsed at about 55Hz, with each LED on about 1/3 of the time at maximum intensity. The frequency is high enough that the LED appears continuously lit. The current draw from a single pin is in spec for the microcontroller. The current supplied to each LED decreases as the total number of LEDs being sourced from the same microcontroller pin increases.</description></item></channel></rss>
