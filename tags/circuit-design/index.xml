This can be solved by opening up the segments of the board edge slightly at the error points and bridging the gaps with short lines.
The problem Kicad printed circuit board (PCB) designer tells you that you have a board edge that is incomplete when you run the design rules check (DRC). You can clearly see that you have a lovely, complete outline with no gaps in it.</description></item></channel></rss>
